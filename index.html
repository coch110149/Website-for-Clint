				<p>
					Hello, and welcome to the first attempt at a website by Clint. The purpose of this site is to help me practice 
					programming techniques as I learn them. This will become my site to tell people about myself. For those who don't know me 
					very well, I ask you check out the life story section and connect with me on your social platform of choice. 
					To everyone, stay tuned. This site will change a bunch. I hope you enjoy it. 
				</p>
