			<h2> About Me: This will be updated soon with the full story as well as a TL;DR </h2>
			<p> <strong> SHORT VERSION</strong>: I was born in Fremont, CA. My mom and I moved to Kentucky where I stayed until the 3rd Grade. 
				She met my dad when I was 8. They married. We moved in together in Greenwood, LA. I finished Middle school there. We moved to 
				California; where I went to high school. I had braces, but once they came off I had a girlfriend. I went to Ireland and the UK. 
				I moved to Springfield, MO to go to college at Evangel University majoring in business management. I met some friends here. 
				I became an atheist, and we kicked out for it. I moved back with my parents in Kentucky and worked two jobs. Those two jobs 
				showed me where most management majors end up. I started to question my life. I had a friend tell me to try programming, 
				since that is what I wanted to do since I was little. So I did and fell in love with it. I moved in with my girlfriend, Amy. 
				I enrolled in school again, this time as a computer science major. I married my girlfriend. My friends stopped being my friends, 
				and I made new ones. I am now working as hard as I can to become a software engineer.
